3)What is negative Infinity? 
->NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity .

4)Which company developed JavaScript?
->JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.

5)What are undeclared and undefined variables? 
->An undefined variable is one that has been declared but does not have a value. An undeclared variable is one that does not exist in the programmer at all.

6)Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? 
->createElement() method.  

Syntax:

document.createElement("<tagName>");  
// Where <tagName> can be any HTML 
// tagName like div, ul, button, etc.

// newDiv element has been created
For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");
Once the element has been created, let’s move on to the setting of attributes of the newly created element.
Setting the attributes of the created element: Attributes can be set using setAttribute() method.  

The syntax and example are as follows:

Element.setAttribute(name, value);
// Where Element is the name of web element. 
// Here, we have created newDiv.
// Where name is the attribute name and 
// value is the value that needs to be set

For Eg: newDiv.setAttribute("class","container");

file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.

11)What are all the looping structures in JavaScript? 
->JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

12)How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript? 
->To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator(+) function is used in javascript. parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn't contain number. If a string with a number is sent, then only that number will be returned as the output.

13)What is the function of the delete operator?
