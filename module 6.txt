3)What are the default Bootstrap text settings?
->Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. In addition, all <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).

4)What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

5)What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 
->The form elements in Bootstrap 4 have defaulted to the browser-provided view. However, in Bootstrap 5, the form elements have a custom design that enables them to have a consistent look and feel in all browsers. The new form controls are based on completely semantic, standard form controls.

6)What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?
->Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together on a single line. This is useful when you want to place items like alignment buttons together.

7)How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?

->On hover, an animated glow outlines the image.

8) In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?
->Flexbox. The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

9)How can one create an alert in Bootstrap? 
->Be sure you've loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.
